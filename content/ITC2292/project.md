## Building a Digital Control System

An assignment has been posted for the submission of Preliminary Project Proposals. One member can submit on-behalf of the group. Please pay attention to the following and if there are any concerns raise them asap.

### Expected Outcome:
Building a closed-loop control system using Arduino Uno as the base hardware for the controller.

### Project Scope:
The selection of a particular project should be bound by available resources and time.

### Resources:
The list of available tools as listed in the attached parts list. If you require any additional components, you will have to discuss that with the lecturer.

### Preliminary Project Proposal:
You are required to submit a preliminary project proposal to screen for suitability of the project against the course requirements. You are advised to adhere to the format below:

 - Project Title
 - List of students in the groups
 - Description of the build (explain how it is a closed-loop control system in 1-2 paragraphs)
 - Any additional requirements

### Deadline for Preliminary Project Proposal:
Before next practical class. We will be discussing each proposal with the group at the next practical class.

### Project Groups: 
Please check your group selections here: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vQHzENmYbbL2wanavVyk-n8cqKGkooyKLTyDUk7R6MerJqBUURedgWMcZUL5zDg6GBHzEiWZXKrmVtH/pubhtml?gid=0&single=true. If your index number is listed with a "No Group" that means you did not provide your index number with you name lists or you didn't send a group selection at all. If you are not assigned a group, please contact me immediately via nimal@sjp.ac.lk.
