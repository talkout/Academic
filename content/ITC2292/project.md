## Building a Digital Control System

An assignment has been posted for the submission of Preliminary Project Proposals. Guidelines on the required format and other details are provided with the assignment under the Materials tab. One member can submit on-behalf of the group. Please pay attention to the following and if there are any concerns raise them asap.

### Expected Outcome:
Building a closed-loop control system using Arduino Uno as the base hardware for the controller.

### Project Scope:
The selection of a particular project should be bound by available resources and time.

### Deadline for Preliminary Project Proposal:
Before next practical class. We will be discussing each proposal with the group at the next practical class.

### Project Groups:

If your index number is listed with a "No Group" that means you did not provide your index number with you name lists or you didn't send a group selection at all.
